# Coin-Flip-Simulator

Using a lot of spanglish.
This is a practice class that can be imported into another python file.

Simulation of a coin toss game. Using a random number generator a function decides if we get a heads or tails (cara or cruz in spanish).
We get $1 if we get heads and lose $1 if we get tails.
Run the simulator to verify the possible result after x number of throws and the behavior the coin experienced.
The simulation can graph the distribution of results and the earnings/loses through every throw.
